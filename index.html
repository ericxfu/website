			<p>I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I love being creative and developing things, and I'm still in the phase of wanting to try everything at least once! I love programming, music (shoutout piano players!), my cat, gaming, hiking, and working with people!</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for taking time out of your day to get to know me better! I'd love to hear from you!</p>
